# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Explored Data In SQL
> Tool: **MySql Workbeanch**

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This project involved cleaning and preparing a dataset titled **[layoffs.csv/]**, which contains global layoff data from various tech and non-tech companies. The dataset includes fields such as company name, industry, number of layoffs, percentage laid off, location, date, and funding stage. The data was often inconsistent, with missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect data types. The goal of the project was to clean and standardize the dataset to enable accurate analysis of layoff trends over time, by sector, and by geography.
