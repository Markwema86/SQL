## 🧠 Overview  
This EDA project explores trends and patterns in a cleaned dataset of global layoffs **[layoffs.csv]**. After performing thorough data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting, the analysis focused on uncovering insights related to layoffs across companies, industries, countries, and time periods. Key areas of analysis included identifying the most affected sectors, peak layoff periods, geographical layoff hotspots, and the correlation between funding stages and layoff rates.
